# Splitsies, a HackNYU 2023 Project

by Cirill Dalangin, Reina Huang, and Madison Phung

## Inspiration

After a fun dinner with your friends, it can be tedious trying to split the bill with everyone, especially if everyone got different things. Splitsies will make this task quick and easy.

## What it does

Users can take a picture of their receipt, then they can choose to split the bill equally or input the individual items each person ordered. They would then be able to customize a note to send to their friends, including their preferred mode of payment, and the app will send it to their friends.

This mobile site is quick and easy to use, no sign up required!

## How we built it

We made a webapp using HTML/CSS/JS and Twilio for the message sending feature

## Challenges we ran into

We weren't sure how to execute our ideas for the app and we had a limited time constraint.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Splities is originated from an interesting concept and we are so proud of ourselves that we translate our ideas into web-based application!

## What we learned

During the process of developing Splities, we realized the difficulties to process inputs from the front-end.

## What's next for Splitsies

- Ability to upload the receipt and let the app read it and convert it to text
